# unit-4-game
the unit-4-game I choose to create was the crystalcollector where the foucs of the game is for the player to use the crystals in the game to add a value to their total and the focus of the game is to get their total vaule to be the same value as a computer generated value if the player were to go over the value the game would reset and the players lose total will go up and a new number will be selected if the player were to achieve the same value then the game would resest and the player wins total will go up.
the player has 4 crystals they can choose from each having a different hidden value un-known to the player that will allow them to add the value of the crystal to their own score in hope that they will be able to get the same value as the value the computer choose for the player to match.
